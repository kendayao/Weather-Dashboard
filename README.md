# Weather-Dashboard


This is a weather dashboard. Languages used for this project are HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. This project uses a third party party API from open weather map to get current and future weather conditions for a specific city. Three API's were used from open weather map to get the current condition of a city, to get future weather conditions, and to get the UV index. 

## Usage

-To start, type in a city name in the text input area.
-Click on search to display the current weather conditions for that city.
-Below the current weather display will show the 5 day weather forecast.
-When a city is typed in and searched, it is saved in the browsers local storage so it can be retreived when the browser is reopened.
-Saved searched cities will appear below the text area and can be clicked on to view weather conditions for that city.
-The list of saved cities can be cleared by clicking on the clear past searches button. This will also removed the saved cities from local storage.
